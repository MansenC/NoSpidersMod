# No Spiders Mod

This mod does what it says. It removes spiders, the ones in deep nest in the foreground. This mod is created for people with arachnophobia so that they can have a good time in deepnest.

## Installation

1) Download the latest release of [Scarab](https://github.com/fifty-six/Scarab/releases). This is the mod manager for Hollow Knight
2) This mod currently is not listed as a mod in Scarab itself, so we have some extra steps here
3) Open Scarab and on the bottom left, if the option `Enable API` exists, click on that button
4) Click on `Open Mods`
5) In that directory create a folder called `NoSpidersMod`
6) Download the latest version of the mod [from here](https://github.com/MansenC/NoSpidersMod/releases)
7) Place the downloaded dll into the created `NoSpidersMod` directory

Now you can start Hollow Knight and enjoy a spiderless experience
